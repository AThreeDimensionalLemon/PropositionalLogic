    Why should a programmer, anyone, be concerned with logic ?

    Write a C++ program that uses logical:  Negation, Conjunction, Disjunction and Tautology in the conditions of an Implication.

    Explain which part of your condition is the Negation, the Conjunction, the Disjunction and the Tautology, and what is the Implication..
